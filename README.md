# vigenere-cipher
This code encrypts and decrypts texts using the Vigen√®re Cipher. This cypher is capable of encrypting alphabetic texts by using a key. Each character in the text is shifted by an amount determined by the character in the key. Each character in the cipher key determines how much to shift the corresponding text character to encrypt or decrypt the text.
